# TODO List

## BUGS

## Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor encryption logic to read data from file and encrypt it.

## High Priority (Core Functionality)
- [ ] Implement Decrypt API endpoint: Create endpoint for decrypting files using private keys.
- [ ] Implement exception handling with meaningful error messages for all CP-ABE operations.
- [ ] Validate all input parameters to prevent security issues and ensure correct CP-ABE operation.
- [ ] Implement file management service to handle storage, retrieval, and cleanup of keys and encrypted files.
- [ ] Create backend integration tests to validate core cryptographic functions.

## Security Features (implement early)
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication for securing API access.
- [ ] Implement secure key storage using encryption or secure storage services.
- [ ] Add structured logging system for all operations, errors, and security events.
- [ ] Create rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

## Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Build user authentication interface with login form and registration.
- [ ] Design responsive dashboard layout for key management and encryption operations.
- [ ] Implement key management UI to view, download, and manage public/master/private keys.
- [ ] Create interactive policy builder with AND operators and attribute selection.
- [ ] Create encryption form for uploading files and specifying attribute-based access policies.
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop file upload with progress indicators.
- [ ] Build file browser for viewing and managing encrypted documents.
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for all cryptographic operations.
- [ ] Create visualization for attribute possession vs. policy requirements.
- [ ] Implement toast notification system for operation success/failure.
- [ ] Design responsive layout for all screen sizes and devices.
- [ ] Add help tooltips for complex CP-ABE concepts and operations.
- [ ] Create UI component tests to ensure frontend reliability.


## Backend Enhancements
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed keys and parameters.
- [ ] Add support for file versioning to track changes to encrypted documents.
- [ ] Implement attribute revocation mechanism to invalidate compromised attributes.
- [ ] Create administrative interface for managing system-wide attributes.
- [ ] Add batch operations for encrypting/decrypting multiple files.
- [ ] Implement key rotation functionality for regular security updates.
- [ ] Create API endpoint for querying available attributes in the system.

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize core CP-ABE operations for better throughput.
- [ ] Add multi-threading support for parallel encryption/decryption operations.
- [ ] Optimize database queries for attribute and policy storage.
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large key structures.
- [ ] Create background processing for long-running encryption tasks.
- [ ] Add compression options for encrypted files to reduce storage needs.
- [ ] Implement performance testing suite to identify bottlenecks.

## Documentation
- [ ] Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all API endpoints.
- [ ] Write user guide explaining CP-ABE concepts and system usage.
- [ ] Create technical documentation covering system architecture and data flows.
- [ ] Document all supported attribute types and policy structures.
- [ ] Create examples of common access policy patterns.
- [ ] Add diagrams explaining the cryptographic workflow.
- [ ] Document deployment instructions for different environments.
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues.
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions and quick start guide.
